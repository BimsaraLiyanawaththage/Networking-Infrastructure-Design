# Networking-Infrastructure-Design
This project focuses on designing and simulating a secure and scalable network infrastructure for an academic institution using subnetting, VLANs, and Cisco Packet Tracer.

Designed and simulated a scalable and secure network infrastructure for the Faculty of Engineering, University of Jaffna, supporting five academic departments and an Administration section. This project focused on network segmentation, security, and future scalability using subnetting, VLANs, and inter-VLAN routing.

ðŸ”¹ Key Highlights:

â€¢ Subnetting & VLAN Design â€“ Allocated unique subnets for each department and implemented VLANs for logical separation.
â€¢ Inter-VLAN Routing â€“ Configured a Layer 3 core switch to manage inter-departmental communication.
â€¢ Secure Device Segmentation â€“ Separated student, staff, and critical devices while optimizing bandwidth usage.
â€¢ Simulation & Validation â€“ Implemented and tested the network using Cisco Packet Tracer, verifying connectivity, security policies, and scalability.
â€¢ Scalability Testing â€“ Designed to accommodate a 30% growth in network infrastructure.

The project enhanced my expertise in network design, subnetting, VLAN configurations, routing protocols, and network security policies.
